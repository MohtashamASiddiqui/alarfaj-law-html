                                On April 24, 2020, the Implementing Regulations of the new Professional Companies Law (the
                                “Regulations”) had been issued. The new Professional Companies Law issued pursuant to Royal Decree
                                number M/17 dated 26/01/1441H (September 25, 2019) (the “Law”) replaces the old Professional
                                Companies Law, issued pursuant to Royal Decree number M/4 dated 18/02/1412H (August 28, 1991)
                                (the “Old Law”).<br>
                                Below is a summary of the most notable provisions of the Law:
                            </p>
                            <h1>Professional Company Definition</h1>
                            <p>
                                
                                The Law defines the professional company as a civil company with a separate legal personality
                                established by one or more individuals who are licensed to undertake one profession or more, alone or
                                with other non-professionals for the purpose of providing these professions.
                                
                            </p>
                            <h1>Corporate Form</h1>
                            <p>
                                
                                Under the Old Law, a professional company was to be formed only as general partnership company
                                (“GPC”). Currently, under the Law, a professional company may be formed as: 1) a GPC; 2) a joint stock
                                company (“JSC”); 3) a limited partnership company (“LPC”); or 4) a limited liability company (“LLC”), as
                                defined under the KSA Companies Law (2016).
                                
                            </p>
                            <h1>Shareholders of a Professional Company</h1>

                            <p>
                                A professional company must be owned by at least one Saudi natural person who is licensed to
                                undertake the profession that the company intends to undertake. For example, a Saudi licensed
                                attorney is required to establish a professional company that undertakes the provision of legal services.
                                
                            </p>

                            <h1>Single Shareholder LLC</h1>

                            <p>
                                For the first time, the Law now allows the establishment of a single shareholder professional LLC. This
                                would be applicable to Saudi shareholders only as the Law requires that Saudi shareholders hold no less
                                than 25% of any professional company’s share capital.
                                
                            </p>

                            <h1>Foreign Professional Companies</h1>
                            
                            <p>
                                Under the Law, non-Saudi professional companies may become partners of Saudi professional
                                companies, as long as the share of the Saudi shareholders is not less than 25% of the company’s capital,
                                as stated in the Regulations. To become a shareholder, the foreign professional company must: 1) have
                                a distinguished reputation in its professional field in its home country; 2) have one or more
                                representatives who have a license to practice the related profession in their home countries; and 3)
                                transfer its expertise and technical knowledge to the Saudi professional company and train Saudi
                                nationals in it.
                                
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The foreign professional company must obtain the license required from the authority regulating its
                                profession in Saudi Arabia. The various authorities regulating different professions have specific
                                requirements applicable to each respective profession. For example, the Ministry of Justice and the
                                Saudi Bar Association regulate the law practice profession. The Ministry of Justice, along with the
                                Ministry of Commerce and the Saudi Bar Association are working on a new project to amend the Code of
                                Law Practice and its Implementing Regulations regulating the law practice profession in Saudi Arabia.
                                The new proposed amendments would include provisions which would be applicable to foreign law
                                firms and lawyers practicing law in Saudi Arabia. Once these amendments are approved, issued and
                                enforced, they will regulate the activities of foreign law firms operating in Saudi Arabia and determine
                                the specific requirements applicable to them.
                                
                            </p>
                            
                            <h1>Non-professional Shareholders</h1>
                            
                            <p>
                                The Law also allows Saudi non-professional shareholders to become shareholders in a professional
                                company, as long as the share of the professional shareholders does not fall below 70% of the
                                company’s capital.

                            </p>
