                            <p>
                                On March 3, 2022, the Board of the Capital Market Authority (the “CMA”) approved the
                                amendment to The Rules on the Offer of Securities and Continuing Obligations. The
                                amendments regulate an additional option through which the capital of companies listed
                                in the capital market (both the main market and the parallel market (Nomu)) is increased
                                through share issuance with the suspension of preemptive rights. This new option, now
                                available for listed companies, is in accordance with Article 140 of the Companies Law,
                                which states that the extraordinary general assembly of a joint-stock company has the
                                right to increase its capital by issuing new shares with the suspension of preemptive
                                right to shareholders.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Limitations</h1>
                            <p>
                                The maximum percentage of the capital increase with the suspension of preemptive right
                                has been set at 15% of the issued capital. The CMA stated that it will continue to study
                                this percentage and may increase it in the future. The amendments also limit the
                                categories of investors to whom the shares are issued through this option to: “Qualified
                                Clients” and “Institutional Clients,” as defined by the CMA. Investors owning the shares
                                through this option may not dispose of such shares for six months following their
                                listing date.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Issuance Requirements</h1>
                            <p>
                                Issuance through this option requires the submission of a prospectus in accordance with
                                the requirements of Annex 10(a) of the Rules on the Offer of Securities and Continuing
                                Obligations. But, unlike in the case of a rights issue, underwriting is not required.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Offering Period</h1>
                            <p>
                                The financial advisor, in consultation with the issuer, may extend the offering period
                                stipulated in the prospectus before the period expires. But investors who subscribed
                                before the extension have the right to cancel or amend their subscriptions.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Capital Increase Options</h1>
                            <p>
                                This new option comes as an additional option to the currently available options to
                                increase the capital of listed companies, which are: 1) rights issue, 2) capitalization
                                issue, 3) debt conversion, 4) acquisition of a company, and 5) asset purchase. All
                                capital increase options require the approval of the CMA before convening the issuer's
                                Extraordinary General Assembly. The approval of the issuer's Extraordinary General
                                Assembly must also be obtained within six months from the CMA’s approval.
                            </p>
