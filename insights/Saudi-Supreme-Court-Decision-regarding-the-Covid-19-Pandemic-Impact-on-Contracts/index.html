                            <p>
                                The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 as a ‘pandemic’ on March 11, 2020
                                (the “Pandemic”). Saudi Arabia and many other countries around the world implemented a
                                series of precautionary measures to limit the spread of the Pandemic. Since then, many
                                contracts governed by Saudi law have been impacted by the Pandemic and the related
                                governmental measures.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                Contracts in Saudi Arabia are governed by the principles of Islamic Law (Sharia). Under
                                these principles, parties to a contract must abide by their contractual terms unless
                                these terms are excused for a legitimate reason under Sharia or found to be inconsistent
                                to Sharia principles and public policy or enacted legislation. To clarify the relevant
                                judicial principles to be applied to contracts affected by the Pandemic, the General
                                Authority of the Saudi Arabian Supreme Court (the “Court”) has issued its Decision
                                Number (45/M) on 08/05/1442H (December 23,2020). The decision stated that the Pandemic
                                will fall under:
                            <ul>
                                <li>the <b>exceptional circumstances</b> category if a contract cannot be performed
                                    without an
                                    unusual loss; and</li>
                                <li>the <b>force majeure</b> category if it causes the performance of a contract to be
                                    impossible.</li>
                            </ul>


                            </p>
                            <h1>Conditions for Application</h1>
                            The Court set the following conditions to apply what is stated in the decision on contracts
                            affected by the Pandemic:
                            <ol>
                                <li> The contract was concluded prior to the Pandemic’s precautionary measures, and its
                                    implementation continues after the occurrence of the measures. </li>
                                <li> The impact of the Pandemic on the contract is direct and unavoidable. </li>
                                <li>The impact of the Pandemic on the contract is independent of any other cause.</li>
                                <li>The party affected by the Pandemic has not waived nor settled its rights. </li>
                                <li>The impact of the Pandemic was not addressed by a specific law or under a decision
                                    of a competent authority. </li>
                            </ol>
                            The Court also stated that the impact of the Pandemic on the contract should be severe and
                            unusual. When assessing the impact, the contract’s activity and timeframe should be
                            considered, and the assessment of the harm should not exceed the period in which the impact
                            of the Pandemic appeared on the contract. One or more experts should do the assessment.

                            <h1>Modification of Contractual Obligations</h1>
                            The decision stipulated that courts, upon the request of the aggrieved party, and after
                            balancing between the parties and considering the surrounding circumstances, may amend a
                            contract impacted by the Pandemic as follows:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Property and movable assets lease contracts:
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>If it was impossible to use the leased property fully or partially due to
                                            the Pandemic, a
                                            court will reduce the rent to the extent that the normal intended use of the
                                            property was
                                            diminished.</li>
                                        <li> The lessor does not have the right to terminate the contract if the tenant
                                            was late in
                                            paying the rent for the period during which it was impossible to use the
                                            property fully or
                                            partially due to the Pandemic.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>Construction and supply contracts:
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>If the Pandemic leads to an increase in the cost of materials, labor wages
                                            or operations,
                                            etc., a court will increase the value of the contract for the obligor
                                            (contractor or
                                            supplier), to the extent of usual reasonable increase. The obligee (owner or
                                            customer) has
                                            the right to seek termination of the contract due to the price increase.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>If the materials’ cost increase due to the Pandemic is temporary, a court
                                            will
                                            temporarily suspend the implementation of the contract.</li>
                                        <li>If the Pandemic causes a shortage of materials in the market, a court will
                                            reduce the
                                            quantity to the extent it deems sufficient to protect the obligor from the
                                            unusual harm.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>If the shortage of materials due to the Pandemic is temporary, a court will
                                            temporarily
                                            suspend the implementation, if the obligee is not seriously harmed by this
                                            suspension. If
                                            the obligee is harmed, the obligee may request termination of the contract.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>If shortage of materials due to the Pandemic is permanent, which make it
                                            impossible to
                                            implement all or some of the contractual obligations, a court, at the
                                            request of one of the
                                            contracting parties, will annul the clauses that are impossible to
                                            implement.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>If it is impossible to implement the obligation to perform the work under a

                                            contract due to the Pandemic, a court will suspend the implementation of
                                            that obligation for
                                            a temporary period. If the obligee is seriously harmed by this suspension,
                                            it may request
                                            termination of the contract.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                            <h1>Restrictions on Hearing COVID-19-Impacted Contract Cases</h1>
                            The Court stipulated that a court considering cases of contracts affected by the Pandemic
                            must adhere to the following:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Decline to enforce liquidated damages or other penalties or termination provisions
                                    included in the contract if the Pandemic was the reason for delaying the
                                    implementation of
                                    the obligation.</li>
                                <li>Cancel the effect of any condition included in the contract that exempts a party
                                    from
                                    liability in the event of exceptional circumstances or force majeure.
                                </li>
                                <li>The burden of proof that the Pandemic has caused any breach of any obligation is on

                            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                            The Court’s decision will clearly be relevant to cases involving contracts affected by the
                            Pandemic. Parties to contracts affected by the Pandemic should be aware that the terms of
                            their contracts may be modified by this decision. They should carefully consider the effect
                            of this decision on their rights and obligations related to these contracts and plan to take
                            the appropriate actions.
