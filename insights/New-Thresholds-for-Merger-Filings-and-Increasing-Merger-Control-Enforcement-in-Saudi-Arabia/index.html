                            <p>
                                On November 1, 2023, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Competition
                                (the “GAC”) announced significant revisions to its merger control notification
                                thresholds. These changes, raising the minimum turnover threshold and adding local nexus
                                requirement, along with the GAC increasing merger control enforcement demonstrate the
                                GAC’s dynamic approach to merger enforcement and its commitment to addressing
                                competitive concerns in the Kingdom.
                            </p>
                            <h1>New Thresholds:</h1>
                            <p>
                                Saudi Arabia’s Competition Law, enacted in 2019, (the “Competition Law”) introduced
                                initial merger control notification thresholds based on parties’ turnover. A filing was
                                initially required, by the Implementing Regulations of the Competition Law and the GAC
                                Merger Review Guidelines, if the combined turnover of participating entities exceeded
                                SAR 100 million (≈USD$ 26.6 million), leading to concerns of excessive filings for
                                transactions with minimal impact on competition.
                                In March 2023, the GAC raised the threshold to SAR 200 million (≈USD$ 53.3 million). The
                                GAC also decreased the filing fee cap from SAR 400,000 (≈USD $106,666.6) to SAR 250,000
                                (≈USD $66,666.6). However, with the lack of a local nexus requirement, this adjustment
                                still posed challenges, particularly for foreign transactions unrelated to the Kingdom.
                                About two thirds of the 316 notifications received by the GAC in 2022 were submitted by
                                foreign companies.

                                On November 1, 2023, the GAC introduced the new thresholds applicable to mergers and
                                acquisitions making it more challenging to trigger a filing requirement. Now, a local
                                nexus requirement is included. A filing is mandatory only if all the below conditions
                                are met:


                            <ol>
                                <li> Worldwide annual turnover of the parties exceeds SAR 200 million (≈USD$ 53.3
                                    million).
                                </li>
                                <li>Worldwide annual turnover of the targets exceeds SAR 40 million (≈USD$ 10.6
                                    million).
                                </li>
                                <li>Domestic annual turnover of a party or parties in the Kingdom exceeds SAR 40 million
                                    (≈USD$ 10.6 million).
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These changes, integrated into the GAC Merger Review Guidelines with immediate effect,
                                signify a positive shift, reducing unnecessary filings and allowing the GAC to
                                concentrate on transactions with higher potential competition implications.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The revised thresholds align with heightened competition enforcement in Saudi Arabia.
                                Under the Competition Law, the GAC can: 1) approve, 2) conditionally approve, or 3)
                                reject the transaction, based on potential competitive effects.
                            </p>

                            <ul>

                                    In late 2021, the GAC issued its first rejection (on procedural grounds) of a
                                    transaction, blocking the Germany-based Delivery Hero’s proposed acquisition
                                    (through a free zone UAE company) of its rival Saudi-based food delivery app The
                                    Chefz SPV Ltd (a registered UAE company as well).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In June 2022, the GAC issued its first rejection (on substantive grounds) of a
                                    transaction, blocking National Gas and Industrialization Co.’s (GASCO) proposed
                                    acquisition of a 55% stake in Best Gas Carrier Co., because of vertical competition
                                    concerns.
                                </p>

                                <li>
                                    <h3>First Conditional Approvals</h3>
                                </li>
                                <p>
                                    In May 2023, the GAC issued its first conditional approval (setting requirements and
                                    conditions for the new entity arising from the acquisition) for Tadawul Advanced
                                    Solutions Co. (Wamid) to acquire a 51% stake in Direct Financial Network Co.
                                    (DirectFN). The GAC added that it will oversee the conduct of companies once the
                                    deal is closed to ensure parties’ commitment to the set requirements for three
                                    years.
                                    <br>
                                    Similarly, in August and September of the same year, the GAC conditionally cleared
                                    the following transactions: Arabian Contracting Services Co.’s (Al Arabia) full
                                    acquisition of competitor Faden Media for SAR 1.05 billion (≈USD 280 million); and
                                    the Saudi based food delivery app Jahez International Company for Information System
                                    Technology full acquisition of its rival, The Chefz SPV Ltd. (the deal did not go
                                    through at the end).
                                    <br>
                                    Conditional approvals include various commitments, such as maintaining competitive
                                    prices, disclosing agreements, restrictions on entering exclusive arrangements,
                                    transferring ownership, and appointing monitoring trustees. Violations of the
                                    conditions set by the GAC are subject to high amounts of fines and potential
                                    annulments of the GAC’s approval decisions.
                                </p>


                            </ul>
                            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                            <p>It remains to be seen but it is expected that the new thresholds will reduce the number
                                of transactions reviewed by the GAC. The GAC is also expected to continue refining its
                                merger control regime, demonstrating its proactive stance in adapting to evolving market
                                dynamics. The combination of new thresholds and increasing merger control enforcement
                                reflects the GAC’s commitment to fostering fair competition while analyzing transactions
                                on an individual basis. As businesses navigate these changes, early engagement and
                                transparent communication with the GAC become pivotal for successful clearances.</p>
