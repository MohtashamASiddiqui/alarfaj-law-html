                                The Capital Market Authority (the “CMA”) is the regulator of investment funds in Saudi
                                Arabia. The CMA announced on 17/7/1442H (March 1, 2021) the amendments of the Investment
                                Funds Regulation and the Real Estate Investment Funds Regulation (the “Regulations”),
                                according to the resolution of the board Number (2/22/2021) in 12/7/1442H (February 24,
                                2021). The amendments to the Regulations will be effective as of 19/9/1442H (May 1,
                                2021), except for some amendments that will be effective as of other dates stipulated in
                                the Regulations.

                            <h1>Introduction about Investment Funds </h1>
                            <p>
                                The CMA defines the investment fund as: “a collective investment scheme aimed at
                                providing investors therein with an opportunity to participate collectively in the
                                profits of the scheme which is managed by a fund manager for specified fees.”
                                <br>
                                According to the CMA’s regulations, Investment funds have many types. In terms of the
                                nature of the fund there are two types:

                            <ol>
                                <li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Open-Ended Investment Fund:</span> “an
                                    investment fund with changing capital, the units of
                                    which would increase with the issuance of new units and decrease with redemption by
                                    unitholders of some or all of their units. Unitholders are entitled to redeem the
                                    value
                                    of their units at their net asset value on dealing days set in the fund’s terms and
                                    conditions in accordance with the Investment Funds Regulations.” Examples of
                                    open-ended
                                    funds include equity funds, money market funds, and debt instruments funds.
                                </li>
                                <li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Closed-Ended Investment Fund:</span> “any
                                    investment fund which is not an open-ended
                                    investment fund.” Rather, it is often capital-specific, and units are only allowed
                                    to be
                                    recovered at the end of the fund’s term disclosed in its terms and conditions or
                                    when
                                    the units are sold to other investors. Closed-ended investment funds may increase
                                    their
                                    capital by inviting participation in the fund if conditions and provisions permit.
                                    The
                                    closed-ended investment fund may or may not be traded. An example of a closed-ended
                                    investment fund is a real estate investment fund.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In terms of offering there are 3 types of funds:
                            <ol>
                                <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Public Fund:</span>
                                    an investment fund which is established in Saudi Arabia and its units may be
                                    offered to investors in Saudi Arabia in any way other than a private placement.
                                </li>
                                <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Private Fund:</span>
                                    a non-public investment fund which is established in Saudi Arabia and its units
                                    may be offered by a private placement to investors in Saudi Arabia.
                                </li>
                                <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foreign Fund:</span>
                                    an investment fund, which is established in a jurisdiction outside Saudi Arabia
                                    and its units may be offered by a private placement to investors in Saudi
                                    Arabia.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                Funds can also be classified by nature of assets to:
                            <ol>
                                <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Equity Fund:</span> is a fund that invests mainly in listed companies’ stocks.</li>
                                <li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Money Market Fund:</span> is a fund that invests in short-term securities and money market
                                    deals. It is characterized with high liquidity, short-term maturity, and low-risk
                                    rates compared to other funds.</li>
                                <li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Debt Instruments Fund:</span> is a fund that invests in debt instruments such as Sukuk and
                                    bonds issued by companies, government and semi-government entities or any other
                                    entity that can issue any kind of debt instruments.</li>
                                <li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Multi-asset Fund:</span> is a fund that invests in several types of assets, such as
                                    stocks, debt instruments, money market deals, and other investment funds.</li>
                                <li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fund of Funds:</span> is a fund that invests all its assets in other investment funds.
                                </li>

                                    assets and devotes part of its investments to short-term financial instruments.</li>
                                <li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Index Fund:</span> is an investment fund that tracks the performance of a specific market
                                    index.</li>
                                These funds can be traded funds or non-traded funds. Traded investment funds
                                are subjected to the same trading rules in the stock exchange, and investors can trade
                                investment fund units like any security. The Investment Funds Regulation stipulates
                                investment restrictions on the various types of investment funds.</li>
                                <li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Real Estate Investment Fund:</span> “a collective real estate investment scheme aimed at
                                    providing investors with an opportunity to participate collectively in the profits
                                    of the scheme.” The objectives of real estate investment funds include:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Initial development then selling.</li>
                                        <li>Construction development then selling.</li>
                                        <li>Initial or constructional development to leasing for a specified period then
                                            selling.</li>
                                        <li>Ownership of properties to leasing for a specified period then selling.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                            </ol>



                            If the real estate fund is traded, the value of its investments in developed real estate,
                            capable of generating periodic rental income, must not be less than 75% of the total value
                            of the fund’s assets. The fund must distribute no less than 90% of its net profits to the
                            unitholders annually.
                            </p>
                            <h1>The New Amendments</h1>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Fund as a Special Purpose Entity</li>
                                <p>
                                    Prior to the new amendments, the contracting has been entered into between the fund
                                    manager and the unitholders directly. The new amendments have enabled investment fund
                                    managers to establish a special purpose entity so that the investment fund has a legal
                                    personality that can be contracted with. This reduces the risk to investors. Keeping the
                                    contracting between fund managers and unitholders is still an option. All provisions
                                    applicable to investment funds generally apply to investment funds in the form of a
                                    special purpose entity.
                                </p>

                                    The amendments included several aspects related to governance, to raise the level of
                                    governance in line with international best practices and standards. For example:
                                    <br>
                                    Strengthening the role of the board of directors of public funds and real estate private
                                    funds in monitoring and supervising the fund manager and protecting the unitholders.
                                    According to the Regulations, each fund is supervised by a board of directors, which
                                    must have no less than three directors. The number of its independent directors must be
                                    no less than two or one third of the total number of the directors, whichever is
                                    greater.
                                    <br>
                                    The amendments enhanced the definition and the role of the independent director, which
                                    contributes to a higher level of governance of these funds. Independent fund director
                                    has been defined to be fully independent of the fund manager. The fund manager does not
                                    have the right to remove any independent director. Independent directors may only be
                                    removed by unitholders. The board must also conduct an annual assessment of the extent
                                    to which the independence of each independent director has been achieved and ensure that
                                    there are no relationships or circumstances that affect or may affect its independence.
                                    A director who has any direct or indirect interest in a matter may not vote on any board
                                    resolution on this matter, and any such interest shall be disclosed to the board.
                                    <br>
                                    The amendments also raised the level of transparency and disclosure in the investment
                                    funds’ periodic reports, with a uniform time limit for the disclosure of financial
                                    statements and annual reports.
                                </p>

                                <li>Regulating Termination and Liquidation Proceedings</li>
                                <p>
                                    The amendments also included regulating the procedures for the termination and
                                    liquidation of public and private investment funds in line with international best
                                    practices and standards. As of 28/07/1443 AH (March 1, 2022), the fund manager must
                                    specify the fund’s termination provisions in the fund’s terms and conditions. For the
                                    termination and liquidation of a fund, the board must approve the termination and
                                    liquidation proceedings.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Traded Investment funds are offered in the main market exchange (the “Exchange”). Nomu
                                    is the parallel stock exchange market in Saudi Arabia, with lighter listing
                                    requirements, and the investment in which is restricted to qualified investors. When the
                                    new amendments come into force, it will also be possible for the following funds to be
                                    offered in the parallel market (Nomu): 1) Real estate investment traded funds (REITs),
                                    2) Closed-ended investment traded funds, and 3) Exchange traded funds, provided that the
                                    offering of their units is restricted to qualified investors.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The new amendments enable close-ended investment traded funds and real estate investment

                                    in the Regulations. These funds can also sell their treasury units through the Exchange
                                    under specific provisions. However, the sale is not required to take place through the
                                    Exchange if the treasury units are intended for use in exchange for the purchase of an
