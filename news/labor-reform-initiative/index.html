                                The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development ("HRSD") launched on November 4, 2020, the Labor Reform Initiative (“LRI”), which applies to all foreign employees in the private sector. LRI has brought about changes regarding job mobility, exit and re-entry visa procedures and final exit visa procedures. Effective March 14, foreign employees in Saudi Arabia will no longer need their employer’s permission to change jobs, travel abroad or leave the country permanently, according to LRI.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The job mobility service under LRI will allow foreign employees to transfer between employers upon the expiry of their binding employment contracts, without the employer’s consent. It also allows the transfer during the contract term, provided there is compliance with the notice period and the specified measures and mechanisms in the employment contract.
                            </p>
                            <p>   
                                The employer’s consent will no longer be required for traveling outside the country. The exit and re-entry visa service will allow a foreign employee to travel outside the country, upon submitting an electronic application with an electronic notification to the employer. The final exit visa service enables foreign employees to leave immediately after the termination of their employment contracts, with an electronic notification to the employer but without requiring its approval. Foreign employees may also leave the Kingdom during their contract terms, with the employee bearing all consequences of the termination of their employment contracts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The new reforms seek to increase the flexibility, effectiveness, competitiveness and attractiveness of the labor market in line with the best international practices and the Saudi Labor Law, according to HRSD.
                            </p>
