								As of Sunday, May 31, the offices of Saudi Arabian ministries, government agencies and private sector companies will reopen and attendance to the workplaces will be implemented gradually, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Tuesday. Full attendance at the workplace shall be by Sunday, June 14, the Minister of Human Resources announced.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Saudi Arabian Supreme Council of Judiciary announced that courts will resume hearings, virtually, on June 7. All cases that have been deferred from March 16 to June 12 will be heard virtually. Notices of hearings will be served electronically.
                            </p>
                            <p>   
                                Wholesale and retail shops, malls, restaurants, cafes, as well as other economic and commercial activities will also be allowed to reopen to the public.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, commercial activities where social distancing rules are difficult to achieve such as barbershops, beauty salons, sports and health clubs, will remain closed until further notice.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                The decision shall ease the curfew in all cities other than Makkah. Movement between cities and regions will again be permitted. Domestic flights will be permitted, although international flights are still prohibited until further notice.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Later, on June 21, all curfews, other than in Makkah, shall be lifted.
                            </p>
